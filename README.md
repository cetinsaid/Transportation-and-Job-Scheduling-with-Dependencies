# Transportation-and-Job-Scheduling-with-Dependencies
This repository contains solutions to two computational problems:  1-Job Scheduling with Dependencies: Compute the minimum time required to complete a set of jobs with varying durations and dependency constraints. Shortest Path Finding: 2-Determine the shortest path between train stations, considering both train connections and walking paths.
